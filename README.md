## About
A site-project I have done when learning front-end development with Vue

## Deployment
Each chapter contains an uncompleted version of the main project in **js** folder.
To run it, you just need to open **index.html** in a modern browser(Brave, Google Chrome, etc...)

## Contribution
Everybody is welcomed to use and contribute to the project.
